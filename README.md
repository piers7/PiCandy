# PiCandyA pixel control server, built in .Net/MonoThis is a general purpose server for controlling LED lighting systems (such as NeoPixels / WS2812) to be controlled over networks (using protocols such as OPC). It's inspired by FadeCandy.(In brief: you can use this to **drive NeoPixels over the network via your Raspberry Pi**)In it's first incarnation the system will support:- Clients attaching via the [Open Pixel Control (OPC)] [opc] protocol, as used by [FadeCandy] [fadecandy]. In particular [Processing] sketches targeting FadeCandy _should just work_.- Driving WS2812 LEDs from a [RPi 2][rpi] via my (mono) fork of the [rpi_ws281x library](https://github.com/piers7/rpi_ws281x/tree/master/mono)In future I hope this project will support multiple protocols, and multiple (pluggable) driver implementations, with probably a LDP8806 implementation next (because I have a strip of those too) and APA102's.##Quick StartAt the moment there's no binary distribution, so you'll have to build the source yourself. However there is a script to pull all the pre-requisites down for building on Raspbian. All you'll need up-front is git:    sudo apt-get update    sudo apt-get install git    git clone https://github.com/piers7/PiCandy.git    cd PiCandy    ./pave.sh    ./build.sh    ./run.sh(TODO: I still need to get the nuget package restore working - the above doesn't work as is)## Why?[FadeCandy] [fadecandy] is great. However I blew up my first board, and whilst I was waiting for a replacement, libraries started to emerge to use RPi's PWM to natively achieve the same thing (more or less). If I could just swap out my FadeCandy server for another OPC implementation, but keep my Processing sketches, I figured I'd be happy. Plus one thing I *don't* like about FadeCandy is the 64 pixel-per-channel limit.##Why Mono?The .net runtime has some fantastic libraries which make writing servers like this really easy, and it's an area I'm relatively familiar with. Plus I was _trying_ to force myself to write more F# (though this is all in C# at the moment)[opc]: http://openpixelcontrol.org/[FadeCandy]: https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy[Processing]: https://processing.org/[rpi]: http://raspberrypi.org
